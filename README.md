# Express

This is a basic guide to setting up an Express.js application using Git for version control and Yarn as the package manager.

# Setup
## Git
To install git and set up your project repository:

- Create a new directory for your project: `mkdir <project-dirname>`
- Change into your project directory: `cd <project-dirname>`
- Initialize a new Git repository: `git init`
- Create an empty Git repository on a platform like GitHub or GitLab
- Add the remote repository URL to your local repository: `git remote add origin <repository clone url>`

## Yarn - Package Manager
To set up Yarn as your package manager:

- Ensure you are in your project directory: `cd <project-dirpath>`
- Initialize your project with Yarn: `yarn init -y`

### Setup Dependencies
- Add Express to your project: `yarn add express`
- Generate an Express skeleton application: `npx express-generator`

## Usage

### Install Yarn Dependencies
- Install all the project dependencies defined in your `package.json`: `yarn install`

### Run the Application
- Start your Express application: `yarn start`

## Test
